19th work

✅ Your Goal:
Make your existing heading extraction pipeline from PDFs support multilingual input, using your current ONNX model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2).

🧠 What You Started With:
ONNX model trained on English (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

Classifier trained on English headings

Working main.py to extract outlines from PDFs

Output cleaning (redundant & junk heading removal)

🚀 What You Accomplished Today:
Task	Status
✅ Integrated language detection (langdetect)	✔️
✅ Added translation step for non-English headings using deep-translator	✔️
✅ Modified the embedding step to use translated text	✔️
✅ Reused existing ONNX model and classifier for multilingual predictions	✔️
✅ Cleaned and deduplicated outline entries (with logging)	✔️
✅ Final main.py is multilingual-ready and logs removed/duplicate entries	✔️
🧠 Confirmed your model does not need retraining if you translate to English	✔️

📂 Final Structure:
input/ → Place PDFs here

output/ → JSON outlines generated

logs_removed.json → Junk/ignored lines

logs_duplicates.json → Duplicate headings skipped

✅ What You Can Do Now:
Extract outlines from any language PDF

Trust the model to clean, classify, and translate headings

Use the JSON output for further apps (TOC, summarizers, etc.)

🔜 Suggested Next Steps:
Add "translated_text" field in JSON output (optional)

Add "lang" field per heading

Build a FastAPI endpoint or web app to upload and view outlines
